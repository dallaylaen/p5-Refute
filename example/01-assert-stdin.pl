This is really a stupid example.
It reads (string, int, int) triads from STDIN and applies simple rules to them:

=over

=item * string must be a valid identifier;

=item * it must be unique;

=item * first int must be nonzero;

=item * second int must be divisible by the first one.

=back

If these conditions are met, a value is added to a global hash
that is printed at the end.
