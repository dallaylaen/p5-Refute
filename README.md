# NAME

**Refute** - unified testing, assertion, and design-by-contract tool

# SYNOPSIS

This module allows to create snippets of code called *contracts*
that behave just as a unit test would,
but do not require the enclosing code to be a unit test:

    use Refute qw(:all) { on_fail => 'croak' };

    # deep in the production code
    my $data = Some::Module->bloated_untestable_sub;
    try_refute {
        like $data->{foo}, qr/f?o?r?m?a?t/;
        is $data->{bar}, 42;
        can_ok $data->{baz}, qw(do_this do_that frobnicate);
    }; # this dies if conditions are not met

This can be transferred *verbatim* into a unit-test,
allowing to find the sweet spot on the `speed <---> accuracy` scale.

# WHY REFUTE

Communicating a passing test/check requires 1 bit of information:
exerything is fine.
When something's not right, however, the more details, the better.

Thus `refute`, an inverted assertion, is the central building block
of this module.

# INSTALLATION

To install this module, run the following commands:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

# CONTENT OF THIS PACKAGE

* `Changes` - change log
* `examples` - really simple scripts demonstrating usage
* `lib` - modules
* `elib` - experimental modules that don't get released to CPAN
* `Makefile.PL`
* `README.md`/`README` - this file
* `t` - tests required for installation
* `TODO` - approximate roadmap
* `et` - tests required for development only
* `.githooks` - author's default pre-commit hooks

The modules include:

* `Refute` - the main frontend with a lot of exports.
It also handles runtime assertions.

* `Refute::Builder` - helper module to build more test conditions
(those would also work fine under Test::More).

* `Refute::Report` - implementation of contract execution *report*.
This is where `refute` is implemented.

* `Refute::Driver::*` - assertion/testing protocol implementations
(currently only Test::More compatibility layer there).

* `Refute::T::*` - extra conditions and checks.
