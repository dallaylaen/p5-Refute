# Tests are grouped.

* `t/0*`: bootstrap: if these fail, bail out and don't waste CPU
* `t/1*`: core modules in isolation (marked with module name)
* `t/2*`: refute_and_report{ ... } mini-apps for most common functionality
* `t/3*`: extra check libraries, experimental features
* `t/4*`: failure mode testing: check warnings, exceptions, and error messages
* `t/5*`: deprecated features (marked with EOL version/date)
* `t/6+`: interoperation with other systems

# NOTE if try_refute{ ... } is utilized in test, it MUST start with

    BEGIN{ delete @ENV{qw(NDEBUG PERL_NDEBUG)} };

# TODO bootstrapping sequence:
1) Verify not_ok(), is_passing(), get_tap(), and get_sign()
2) Verify refute_and_report { ... }
3) Verify is, like assertions
4) Verify contract_is, test_test assertions
5) Verify working in a harness using fork & pipe
